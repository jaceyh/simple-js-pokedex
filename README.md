My Pokedex app is a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It loads data from an external API[^1] and enables the viewing of data points in detail.


To try it out, click on any Pokemon button to view its data in a modal.


This app was built using VS Code and deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
